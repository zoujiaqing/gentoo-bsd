Tips for using this repo.

* Keep its layout in a format that it can be cleanly used as a portage overlay
* It's good to keep fixed versions of @system packages that take longer to get
  committed into gentoo-x86
* Try to keep category names consistent: sys-<yourbsd>
* profiles/ and eclass/ are fine, make sure your "parent" files point to the
  proper locations.
